<h1>Assignments: Python Functions</h1>

<h3>1. The Calculator App</h3>

<h6>Objective:</h6> The aim of this assignment is to build a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

<h5>Task 1:</h5> Create functions for each arithmetic operation.

<h5>Task 2:</h5> Use inputs to ask the user what operation they want to perform, and what numbers they want to use.

<h5>Task 3:</h5> Ensure your code can handle division by zero and other potential errors. So if you divide by 0, there is error handling set up to prevent an error from showing in the console.

<h3>2. The Shopping List Maker</h3>

<h6>Objective:</h6> The aim of this assignment is to create a program that helps users make a shopping list.

<h5>Task 1:</h5> Write a function that lets the user add items to a list.

<h5>Task 2:</h5> Include a function to remove items from the list.

<h5>Task 3:</h5> Add a function that prints out the entire list in a formatted way.

<h6>Note:</h6> The goal of this is to be a program. The recommendation is to use a while loop that will allow the user to continue to add, remove, and print off their shopping list until they decide to "quit", also known as breaking the loop.

<h6>NOTE:</h6> Ensure that all code in your file is ready to run. This means that if someone opens your file and clicks the run button at the top, all code executes as intended. For example, if there are if statements, print statements, or for loops, they should function correctly and display output in the console as expected. If you have a function, make sure the function is called and runs.

The goal of this note is to ensure that all code in your Python file runs smoothly and that is has been tested.
